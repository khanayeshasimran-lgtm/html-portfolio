 <h1>The Best Movies According to Ayesha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie.The film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.</p>
<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie. Ex Machina is a master example of using sleight of hand within the story, playing with strategies and emotional manipulation in ways that keeps the audience guessing as we see different possibilities that are all plausible.</p>
<h3>Mission Impossible</h3>
<p>the final reckoning Highlights: Tom Cruise's Stunts, Spectacular Action, Enduring Star Power.</p>
